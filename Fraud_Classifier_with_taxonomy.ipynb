    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This code implements an automated fraud analysis system that processes customer fraud inquiry documents using AI-powered classification and risk assessment. The system leverages LangChain, OpenAI GPT models, and LangGraph to create a comprehensive workflow that ingests text documents, extracts fraud-related information using a predefined taxonomy, applies business rules for risk scoring, and generates structured reports in both JSON and CSV formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "It designed for easy extensibility and future enhancements. While the current implementation follows a straightforward linear workflow, the LangGraph framework enables seamless addition of complex features."

    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Financial Institution Fraud Departments\n",
    "- Scenario: A bank receives hundreds of fraud complaints daily via email, phone transcripts, and web forms.\n",
    "- Application: Automatically categorize incoming reports, identify high-priority cases (large monetary losses, urgent language), and route them to appropriate specialists\n",
    "- Benefit: Reduces initial triage time from hours to minutes, ensures critical cases aren't missed in high-volume periods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customer Service Operations\n",
    "- Scenario: Multi-channel customer complaints about fraudulent activities need consistent handling regardless of source.\n",
    "- Application: Process complaints from various channels (chat logs, emails, call transcripts) into standardized format for case management systems\n",
    "- Benefit: Ensures consistent service quality, reduces response time for urgent cases"

    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fraud Taxonomy Schema. \n",
    "- A comprehensive classification system with 7 main categories (Digital Fraud, Payment Fraud, Identity Fraud, Account Takeover, Card Fraud, Social Engineering, Internal Fraud), each with specific subcategories and associated channels, ensuring consistent fraud classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FrudAnalysisState Model: \n",
    "- A Pydantic-based data model that maintains all relevant information throughout the processing pipeline, including document content, extracted fraud details, risk assessments, and processing metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangGraph Workflow: \n",
    "- LangGraph Workflow: A state-driven processing pipeline with four main nodes - document ingestion, comprehensive AI analysis, business rule application, and report generation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comprehensive Analysis Engine. \n",
    "- A prompt-engineered system that uses structured output to extract fraud types, monetary impact, urgency indicators, and risk scores while strictly adhering to the predefined taxonomy relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Rules Engine.\n",
    "- Automated risk scoring logic that combines urgency indicators and monetary impact to classify cases as Low, Medium, or High risk, with automatic flagging for human review based on ambiguous classifications or high-risk scenarios."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This fraud analysis system provides a scalable, consistent approach to processing fraud inquiries that combines the power of large language models with structured business logic. By automating the initial classification and risk assessment phases, organizations can significantly improve their fraud response times while ensuring human experts focus their attention on the most critical and complex cases requiring manual intervention."

    "1. CATEGORY VALIDATION:\n",
    "   - ONLY use categories that exist exactly in the taxonomy above\n",
    "   - Valid categories are: \"Digital Fraud\", \"Payment Fraud\", \"Identity Fraud\", \"Account Takeover\", \"Card Fraud\", \"Social Engineering\", \"Internal Fraud\"\n",
    "   - If no category matches, use \"Unknown\"\n",
    "   - NEVER create new categories or modify existing names\n",
    "\n",
    "2. SUBCATEGORY VALIDATION:\n",
    "   - ONLY use subcategories that belong to the selected category\n",
    "   - Each subcategory has a specific parent category - respect this relationship\n",
    "   - If fraud matches a category but no subcategory fits, use \"Unknown\"\n",
    "   - NEVER mix subcategories from different categories in a single fraud_types object\n",
    "\n",
    "3. CHANNEL VALIDATION:\n",
    "   - ONLY use channels that are valid for the selected category\n",
    "   - Each channel list is specific to its parent category\n",
    "   - If channel isn't listed for that category, use \"Unknown\"\n",
    "   - NEVER mix channels from different categories in a single fraud_types object\n",
    "\n",
    "4. MULTIPLE FRAUD TYPES:\n",
    "   - If incident involves multiple fraud categories, create SEPARATE fraud_types objects\n",
    "   - Each fraud_types object must maintain category-subcategory-channel consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "5. UNKNOWN/AMBIGUOUS VALUES:\n",
    "   - Use \"Unknown\" when category/subcategory/channel cannot be determined\n",
    "   - Use \"Ambiguous\" when multiple options seem equally likely within same category\n",
    "\n",
    "6. ERROR PREVENTION:\n",
    "   - Do NOT assume relationships - always check the taxonomy\n",
    "   - Do NOT use partial matches (e.g., \"Phish\" instead of \"Phishing\")\n",
    "   - Do NOT create hybrid categories or subcategories\n",
    "   - Do NOT default to the most common fraud type if it doesn't match the evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "7. URGENCY AND MONETARY IMPACT:\n",
    "   - For urgency: True if client language indicates immediate need (words like \"immediately\", \"ASAP\", \"help now\", etc.)\n",
    "   - For monetary_impact: Extract numeric value if mentioned, otherwise null\n",
    "   - Keep extraction_reason concise (1-2 sentences max)\n",
